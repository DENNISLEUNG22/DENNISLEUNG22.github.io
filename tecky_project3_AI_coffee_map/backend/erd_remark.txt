/*---------- Remark ----------*/
-->for the shop table
`all the data scrapped by google map without any library (more flexible)
`it is normal that some data will be null
`google map will keep update, therefore, I need to scrapped the website in different time log
`owner_id must be null at first, it is provided by the users later 

-->for the user table 
`due to unfinished log-in/register system
we need to create fake user and connect to shop table with owner_id
`why separated the user table and shop table 
normally, one user can own multi-shop 
but, shop can only have one admin account in this case 
too trouble and complicated to fixed it
so, give up 

--> for the coffee table 
`all data should be provided by user, which means shop owner can also comment other shop
`name Eg, americano, latte 

--> for the coffee_content table 
`one coffee may included multi-coffee beans 
so, must separated bean, coffee_content, and coffee table 
for frontend filter and add additional function easily 

--> for the bean table 
`AI part: after training, the result should be show in the screen (only frontend and no need to insert any data in DB)

--> for the coffee_variant table 
`this variant means the size of coffee, eg, grande, large etc 
`each size with different price 
`make sense to separated this table too

--> for the taste_report 
`all type set to integer, and provided the selector in frontend for user choosing 

--> for searching/ filter in the map 
`four filter 
`filter by...shop name, location, coffee_variant name, bean brand 
`location can based on current location
